## Purpose of the app: 

This project is a scoial platform that allows users to track their own applicatins and provide a community to support other developers in their job search.

## How to use: 

On initial page load, the user is brought to the home page where they can add emojis to other job seekers applications for support. For a user to add an application of therir own, they must register an account and login. On the tracker page a user is able to see all their application, update their applications stage, ADD/DELETE an application, or search by company name or job title using the dynmaic search bar. Once a user adds an application that then updates the feed where other users on the app can show support to the added application. A rejection letter also updates the feed for support from the community. On the profile page a user can see their stats of how many emojis they've received from other users, also a user can update their profile image by uploading the picture of their choice and clicking the save button. The top 5 page is a leaderboard for trakcking how many applications each user has submitted in a descending order.
